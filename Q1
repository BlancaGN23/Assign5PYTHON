#using python, and not calling any hardcode operations, find the standard deviation of a list of numbers


#call math header, use for siple operations
import math

#set some initial variables = 0
sum = 0
size = 0
runsum = 0


#predefine an array - not sure if this is considered hard coding 

array=[2,4,5,8,-10]

#iterate through the numbers in the array to find the sum, and the size 
for x in array:
	sum = sum + x	
	size = size+1

#calcuation for sum
avg = sum/size

#iterate throught the array again, to subtract each number from the average, take the square, and add it to the running sum, which is the top value of the stddev equation
for x in array:
	runsum = (x - avg)**2 + runsum

#stdev calculations 
#instead of square root, to the 1/2 power
stdev = (runsum/size)**.5
	

#print out some values of interest
print('sum is', sum)
print('size is', size)
print('avg', avg)
print('Stdev', stdev)
