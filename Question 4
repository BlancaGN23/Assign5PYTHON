#Like a hipster, find the Riemann sum of the equation

#import basic operation header, set AT = 0
import math
AT = 0

#user input limits, number of bins
#set these values as integers
nb = input("Starting limit: ")
lim1 = int(nb)

nb2 = input("Ending limit: ")
lim2 = int(nb2)

nb3 = input("Number of bins: ")
bins = int(nb3)

#from these values, find width of each bin
width = (lim2 - lim1)/bins
x = int(lim1)


#before we hot the ending limit
#calculate the height at each point
#find area = width * height
#AT is running total of areas
while (x<lim2):
	H = (3*x*x*x) - (4*x*x) + (3.2198*x)
	A = width*H
	AT = AT + A
	x = x + width
	
#print out total area under the curve
print ("Area under curve: ", AT)


#For this script, only the equation is hard coded
#For the equation given, I found the following values per number of bins
#n = 10: 3357.21
#n = 50: 3928.34
#n = 100: 4002.88
#n = 500: 4063.02
#as expected, the more number of bins gives you a more accurate approximation 
#these values are compared to the actual integral result = 4078.13
