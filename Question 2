#WHAT I NEED TO DO
#open with (text file)
#iterate through the text file, adding each column to a seperate array
#i couldn't figure this part out, I was having trouble with the delimiter - or figuring out how to specify the spacing between columns
#once that was semi-solved, I couldn't convert the str characters to floats
#the odd part is that I was able to do this with C++




#ATTEMPT AT SOLUTION, but doesnt work
#open text file
#with open ("/home/ubuntu/Desktop/randompairs.txt", 'r') as data:

	#iterate through the file,
	#for line in data, adding column 1(0) to arrayx, column 2 (1) to arrayy
	#when adding the value tothe array, convert it to a float
		#cols1 = line.split(",")
		#arrayx.append(float(cols1[0]))
		#cols2 = line.split(",")
		#arrayy.append(float(cols2[1]))






#iterate through the lists to find their size and sum of all values
for x in arrayx:
	sumx = sumx + x
	sizex = sizex + 1

for y in arrayy:
	sumy = sumy + y
	sizey = sizey + 1

#averages for each list
xavg = sumx/sizex
yavg = sumy/sizey

	#iterate through the lists again to get the value - average, square and sum - equals the top portion for the standard deviation equation
for x in arrayx:
	stdsumx = (x-xavg)**2 + stdsumx 

for y in arrayy:
	stdsumy = (y-yavg)**2 + stdsumy 

	#Expectation values
	#iterate through the values in the list, add x and y components, divide by size of list
for i in range (1, sizex):
	E=arrayx[i]+arrayy[i]
	Esum = E + Esum
	Exp = Esum/sizex

	#final standard deviation calculations for X and Y
	STDX = (stdsumx/sizex)**0.5
	STDY = (stdsumy/sizey)**0.5
	
	#Final calculations for P
	P = (Exp - (xavg * yavg))/ (STDX*STDY)


print ("Linear correlation coefficient is", P)
