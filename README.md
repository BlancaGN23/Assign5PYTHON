# Assign5PYTHON
As mentioned, I first did the programs in C++. 
When redoing them in python, I found it was much easier! And I was able to use double for /while loops, which I couldn't figure out how to work in C++
I had trouble reading in the double column of text in python (Q2). 
Which is odd because I WAS able to do this in C++.
